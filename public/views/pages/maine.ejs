<p>At this point in time Ahil was a working man. His summer job started in June and we needed to go on at least one trip this
    summer. We needed something short but something that would also create lots of fun memories. Acadia National Park was
    perfect. We saw beautiful sunrises, hiked beaches and mountains, encountered some wonderful overlooks and, ate some amazing
    seafood and ice cream. We went on a couple hikes but one was very different than what we were used to. It took more effort
    and strength than any other hike we had ever experienced. We also got lost in the middle. At the end of the Schoodic
    Point hike, we were better stronger people. I did not think this trip would be very fun, but now I can never forget the
    wonderful time I had in Maine. </p>
